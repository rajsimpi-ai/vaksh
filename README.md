# vaksh
Say "vak" and type your prompt for a linux based command without any linux knowledge 
# VakSh ⚡

*Speech to Shell, Words to Power*

> **VakSh (वाक्श)** — Inspired by *Vāk*, the Vedic goddess of speech. VakSh transforms natural language prompts into **Linux commands** you can review and execute — putting you in full control. In Sanātana Dharma, **Vāk** is the goddess of speech — words themselves have the power to create.
VakSh brings this to the digital world:

*Your words → clear commands → executed when you decide.*

## ✨ Features

* 🗣 **Prompt to Command** – Speak in natural language, get the right shell command.
* 👀 **Review Before Execution** – VakSh never runs a command blindly; you confirm it.
* ⌨️ **Interactive CLI** – Accept, reject, or refine suggested commands easily.
* 🌱 **Extensible** – Future support for multi-step chains & custom shells.

## 🔧 Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/vaksh.git
cd vaksh

# Setup script (coming soon)
./setup.sh
```

*(Global install instructions will be added soon)*

## 🚀 Usage

Use **`vak`** followed by your prompt:

```bash
vak "make a folder named images"
```

**VakSh Suggests:**

```bash
mkdir images
```

You now have options:

* ✅ Press **Enter** to execute.
* ✏️ Press **Ctrl + E** (example keybinding) to edit/refine your prompt.
* ❌ Press **Ctrl + C** to cancel.

## 🌳 Branching Workflow

We maintain two main branches:

* **`development`** → Active work happens here.
* **`production`** → Stable, release-ready branch.

Contributors should open PRs into `development`. Merges to `production` happen after testing.

## 🛠 Roadmap

* [ ] Setup script for easier installation
* [ ] Configurable keybindings for review/edit flow
* [ ] Multi-step command chaining
* [ ] Support for different shells (bash, zsh, fish)
